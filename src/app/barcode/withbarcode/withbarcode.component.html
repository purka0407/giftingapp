              <strong> Lorem ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and
              typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
              text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
              and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
              five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
              essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
              of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
              with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
              of Lorem Ipsum.
